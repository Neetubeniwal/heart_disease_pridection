# heart_disease_pridection

The Heart Disease Prediction System uses Machine Learning to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. It helps doctors and patients with early diagnosis and preventive care.

🚀 Features

Predicts heart disease risk using ML algorithms

Data preprocessing and feature correlation analysis

Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Interactive GUI built using CustomTkinter

Visual insights with graphs and charts

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, CustomTkinter
